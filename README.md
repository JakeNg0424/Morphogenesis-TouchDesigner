I wanted to create a series of neon digital threads overlapping one another. The end result resembles colorful textile sewing itself.

Using multiple TouchDesigner's nodes to create diffusion, stability, and growth, the lines would grow and grow while avoiding being diffused into each other too much, successfully overlapping digital thread without losing its structure.
